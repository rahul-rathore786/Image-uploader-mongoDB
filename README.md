## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://www.linkpicture.com/q/img-up1.png)

The Image Uploader Website is a simple and responsive web application that allows users to upload images with titles and descriptions. The uploaded images are stored in a MongoDB database, and the website is built using Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic and interactions with the database. The website aims to be user-friendly, providing an intuitive and straightforward interface for users to interact with.

## Built With

* **Node.js:** The server-side logic is built using Node.js, allowing for efficient handling of image uploads, database interactions, and serving the website's content.

* **Express.js:** Express.js is used as the web application framework, simplifying the setup of routes and middleware for handling HTTP requests and responses.

* **MongoDB:** MongoDB serves as the database to store user-uploaded images, titles, and descriptions. It provides flexibility and scalability for handling image data.

* **HTML5:** The website's structure is built using HTML5, providing a solid foundation for organizing the content and layout.

* **CSS3:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3) are used to style the website, creating an attractive and responsive user interface.

* **JavaScript:** Client-side JavaScript is employed for handling image uploads, gallery rendering, and user interactions. It enhances the overall user experience and interactivity of the website.
